How to talk about daily routines My daily routine is nothing special. I usually wake up early, around 7 a.m. Breakfast is not important to me, so I usually only drink a cup of coffee. Sometimes, though, I will have an apple. Breakfast is followed by a shower. After I get dressed, I go to work. Work is always the same during the morning. I respond to emails and set up meetings. Around lunchtime, I start to feel really hungry. Often, my friends and I meet at a cafe to have lunch together. When dinnertime comes around, however, I cook dinner at home. After dinner, I take my dog for a walk to the park. We can usually see the sunset, which is quite beautiful. I watch TV series or movies at night. There is nothing like a good movie before bed. I sleep at 10 p.m. and then start the whole routine over again the next day.
